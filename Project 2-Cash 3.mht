<P align=3Dcenter><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D5><STRONG>Project 2-Cash=20
3</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2><STRONG>Description: </STRONG>In this =
project, you=20
will gain experience with classes, objects, random numbers, and control=20
structures.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2><STRONG>Details:</STRONG> Write a =
program to=20
simulate the Cash 3 lottery game. For simplicity, it will only simulate =
the=20
straight play. That is, you must guess the numbers in exact order. For =
this=20
project, I have provided a file named </FONT><A=20
href=3D"http://ww2.cs.fsu.edu/~porter/cop3014/summer2010/projects/cash3.h=
"=20
target=3D_blank><FONT face=3DVerdana =
size=3D2><STRONG>cash3.h</STRONG></FONT></A><FONT=20
face=3DVerdana size=3D2>. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>Your first task is to write a =
corresponding=20
implementation of the class functions in class <STRONG>Cash3</STRONG>. =
Put these=20
implementations in a file named <STRONG>cash3.cpp</STRONG>. There are =
four=20
functions to implement. The first three simply return the value of the=20
corresponding class variable, which will be a number from 0 to 9. The=20
<STRONG>Draw() </STRONG>function will set each of the class variables to =
a=20
random number from 0 to 9.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>Your second task is to create a driver =
program in a=20
file named <STRONG>cash3driver.cpp</STRONG>. Your driver will make use =
of a loop=20
to ask the user to enter three numbers. Upon entering the three numbers, =
you=20
will use a <STRONG>Cash3</STRONG> object to draw three random numbers. =
You will=20
then compare the drawn numbers to the ones the user entered and print to =
the=20
screen whether the user has won or lost. At the end of the loop, you =
will ask=20
the user if they want to play again. If they type the character 'y' or =
'Y',=20
assume that they do. Otherwise, assume that they don't and exit the =
program. You=20
can assume valid input from the user. That is, you can assume three =
integral=20
numbers from 0 to 9, separated by space(s), will be entered. See my =
sample runs=20
below to compare.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2><STRONG>Programming Tips:</STRONG> =
Random numbers=20
are an interesting topic in computing. In C++, we have two functions =
that=20
facilitate the generation of random numbers: <STRONG>srand()</STRONG> =
and=20
<STRONG>rand()</STRONG>, both defined in the header=20
<STRONG>&lt;cstdlib&gt;</STRONG>. Pages 220-225 of your book will show =
you an=20
example of how to use them. Next, you may find it useful to use =
</FONT><A=20
href=3D"http://ww2.cs.fsu.edu/~porter/cop3014/summer2010/projects/cash3.h=
"=20
target=3D_blank><FONT face=3DVerdana =
size=3D2><STRONG>cash3.h</STRONG></FONT></A><FONT=20
face=3DVerdana size=3D2> as a reference for how to format and comment =
your own code.=20
You will notice an identifier being defined near the top of the file =
that may=20
look strange. It's used to prevent multiple inclusion of the file in the =

compilation process. Even though we don't cover chapter 9, the book =
gives a good=20
explanation of why we use this mechanism on page 398. You will want to =
use the=20
same mechanism in <STRONG>cash3.cpp</STRONG>. These identifiers should =
be=20
unique. So, you can use <STRONG>CASH3_CPP</STRONG>, for example. Note =
that=20
<STRONG>YOU WON'T</STRONG> want to use this mechanism in your driver =
file=20
(<STRONG>cash3driver.cpp</STRONG>). </FONT></P>
